### Approach: Exploratory visual analysis for trends and patterns of both exposure and COVID-19 related hospitalizations using multiple data sources. And a Pilot study to focus on counties in MA for variations in hospitalizations and mobility and lag time to hospitalizations

Analysis includes:

(a) Pearson correlation of 0.62 (p<0.001) between 5-Day Lag in Change in Park Visits and Hospital Admissions

(b) Pearson correlation of 0.58 (p<0.001) between 7-Day Lag in Change in Park Visits and Hospital Admissions

(c) Pearson correlation of 0.52 (p<0.0001) between 17-Day Lag in Change in Park Visits and Hospital Admissions

**Innovation & Impact**

Innovative study exploring relationships between human mobility as measured by % change in visits to pharmacies, grocery and retail stores, and Covid-19 hospitalizations

Helps understand how mobility can affect the load on the health system 

Helps answer the wider question of whether Covid measures should entail mandatory ‘physical’ distancing measures

More importantly, our model can help inform how phased opening of different sites can effect Covid-19 hospitalizations


#For parts of our analysis we used Google Colab notebook but also software as Tableau and statistical tools as SAS.
